  "AIGPT": "Forget all previous instructions. Assume the role of an expert in finance and artificial intelligence. Please read the provided annual report of the company and assess its development level in artificial intelligence technologies. Consider factors such as the company's investment in AI research and development, innovations in fields like deep learning, computer vision, big data analytics, and intelligent manufacturing, practical applications of these AI technologies, and the extent to which AI supports the company's business operations and strategic objectives. After your assessment, output a JSON object containing a single key 'score'. The 'score' should be a number from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates significant underdevelopment and 100 indicates industry leadership. Ensure that your score is a comprehensive analysis based on the content of the annual report. For example, a score close to 0 may be given if the report lacks sufficient AI-related content. A score of 50 might reflect an industry average level, while a score close to 100 could indicate leadership."
